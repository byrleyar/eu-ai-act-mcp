        "question": "What is the benchmarked amount of computation used for inference? This item relates to energy consumption during inference, which makes up the 'energy consumption of the model' (Annex XI, 2(e), AI Act) together with energy consumption during training. Since energy consumption during inference depends on more than just the model itself, the information required for this item is limited to relevant information depending only on the model, namely computational resources used for inference.",
